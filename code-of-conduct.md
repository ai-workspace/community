# Elyra Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Project Elyra is an engaged and respectful community. As contributors and maintainers of this project,
and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting 
pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, 
regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, 
personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces related and/or managed by the Elyra contributors, including Gitter,
issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this
Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles
to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
may be permanently removed from the project team.

We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in the Elyra community
formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with Elyra, in any project-related activities
and especially when representing the project or its community, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative,
shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can
enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## Specific Guidelines

We strive to:

 * Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We preferably use public methods of communication
   for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or 
   project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer
   to a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by people answering will be more easily
   detected and corrected.

 * Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions,
   and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time,
   but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable 
   or threatened is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as 
   well as with people outside our community.

 * Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others.
   When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works,
   so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues,
   and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.

 * Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are
   encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and
   helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving Apache project code.

 * Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, 
   we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. 
   Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. 
   This includes, but is not limited to:
   
   * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
   * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
   * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
   * Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
   * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
   * Unwelcome sexual attention.
   * Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
   * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
   * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

 * Be concise. Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of persons. Writing a short email means
   people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic,
   welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary.

 * Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each mail adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind
   that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.

 * Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.

 * Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the
   project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up
   where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the
   project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should
   respect any individual's choice to leave the project.

## Reporting Guidelines

While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we recognize that sometimes people may have a
bad day, or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you may reply to
them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most
appropriate. However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still adhere to the
relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or disrespectful.

If you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, you may reply to them and point out this
code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith;
it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that they intentionally try to
degrade the quality of the discussion. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, 
you may report your compliance issues in confidence to either one of our volunteers:
