*NOTE: This document is intended to provide an example governance structure for any LF AI and Data Foundation project to consider as a starting point. All projects hosted by LF AI and Data Foundation are not bound by these governance polices, but in absence of any prior governance structure should consider this as a recommended structure*

# Overview

This project aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affilation. Participants are bound to the project's [Code of Conduct].

## Community Roles

### Contributors
Contributors are Members who are active/inactive contributors to the community. They can have issues and Pull Requests assigned to them. Contributors can be active in many ways including but not limited to:

* Authoring or reviewing PRs on GitHub
* Filing or commenting on issues on GitHub
* Contributing community discussions (e.g. Slack, meetings, Gitter, email discussion forums, Stack Overflow, etc)
* Creator of content, promotion and advocating

Active Contributors are defined as anyone from the community with twenty (20) or more measurable contributions 
during the previous 12-month period, inclusive of code merged, code reviews performed, documentation page edits, 
(creation, modification, comments or attachments)

### Committers
Contributors who give frequent and valuable contributions to a subproject of the Project can have their 
status promoted to that of a Committer for that subproject. A Committer has write access to the source code 
repository and gains voting rights allowing them to affect the future of the subproject.

In order for a Contributor to become a Committer, another Committer can nominate that Contributor or the Contributor can ask for it.
Once a Contributor is nominated, all Committers will be asked to vote. If there are at least 3 positive votes and no negative 
votes, the Contributor is converted into a Committer and given write access to the source code repository. 

### Technical Steering Committee
The Technical Steering Committee has a set of rights and responsibilities including the following:

* Define, evolve, and defend the vision, values, mission, and scope of the project.
* Define, evolve, and defend a Code of Conduct,  which must include a neutral, unbiased process for resolving conflicts.
* Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including how members become contributors etc.
* Decide, for the purpose of elections, who is a member of standing of the Elyra project, and what privileges that entails.
* Decide how and when official releases of Elyra artifacts are made and what they include.
* Declare releases when quality/feature/other requirements are met.
* Control access to, establish processes regarding, and provide a final escalation path for any Elyra repository, which currently includes all repositories under the Elyra-AI GitHub organization
* Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding other project resources/assets, including artifact repositories, build and test infrastructure, websites and their domains, blogs, social-media accounts, etc.

# Release Process

Please refer to each respective repository for their release cycles.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and committer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the committers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the committers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each committer receives one vote.

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the [Code of Conduct], this project will:

* Keep all communication on open channels ( mailing list, forums, chat ).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members ( such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc ).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the committers.
